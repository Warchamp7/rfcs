# Summary

Change the default theme in OBS to a cleaner, more modern looking and approachable design

# Motivation

The current default theme (Dark) is very dated design-wise. It uses a rather small font size and has a lack of padding or margins on most elements.

While this allows the theme to be very compact, it leads to the interface feeling very cramped and is intimidating to new users due to visual overload.

The suggested replacement is a new theme I've designed that I've tentatively named Yami. It has a larger font size, more space around elements to let them breathe, and a better color heirarchy (Buttons and elements are brighter than their containers, which are brighter than the background)

# Drawbacks

Some users will undoubtedly prefer Dark for it's sleek and compact design.

As such, I would recommend we keep under a new name such as "Compact" and have this new theme take the name "Dark"

# Additional Information

This theme is mostly complete pending anything I've missed, and available for testing on the obs-studio repo.
